Asseco eHealth Hackaton

Proof of concept for the Asseco Healthcare Hackathon 2015. We decided to make a service showing the closest ambulance, dentist or pharmacy on the map, so that people in need could easily find the help.

Simple HTML + Javascript web page with Google Maps fed by some static data.

We won the #1 price with this project prototype.
