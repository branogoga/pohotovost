Asseco eHealth Hackaton - eMERGINO

Proof of concept for the Asseco Healthcare Hackathon 2015 in Bratislava. We decided to make a service showing the closest ambulance, dentist or pharmacy on the map, so that people in need could easily find the help.

Simple HTML + Javascript web page with Google Maps fed by some static data.

We won the #1 price with this project prototype. Official statement: https://ce.asseco.com/press/spravy/asseco-ce-odmenilo-uspesnych-riesitelov-prveho-slovenskeho-ehealth-hackathonu-1116/
